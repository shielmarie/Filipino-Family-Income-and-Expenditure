#Dataset: Filipino Family Income and Expenditure

#Short analysis: 
#Using the Filipino Family Income and Expenditure dataset from kaggle.com, 
#it is shown that all Visayas regions (VI, VII, and VIII) are the top 3  
#highest income earners in the Philippines. Their sources of income are coming from:
#1. other sources of income and 2. entrepreneurial activities.

#The top 3 lowest income earners are coming from BARMM, Region V (Bicol), and Region I (Ilocos Region). 
#Their source of income are mostly coming from wage/salaries.

#Although Region VI has the highest total household income, Region VII has the highest total food expenditure.

#Most of the household heads are male for married marital status. While for other marital status(single, widowed, separated, and
#annulled), most of the household head are female.
